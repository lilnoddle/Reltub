	<h2 class="email">RELTUB Co. is aiming to create robotic butlers to make life easier for people. RELTUB’s robot does menial tasks that people don’t want to do, therefore making life easier for customers around the world. I am kindly asking if you could invest 90,000 dollars in our company. This money would go to buying the pieces to create the robot and advertising. If you do decide to invest, you can expect 200%  returns of the money that you invested in us. If you invest, this will help make life easier around the world through our robots. Please contact us if you have any questions.</h2>
