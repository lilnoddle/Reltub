<h2 class="title">Summary</h2>
<h2 class="excSummary">Reltub was created by Billy Bob Joe to make life easier around the world through robotic butlers. He created it after his grandfather died from not being able to reach the cookie jar--which was placed on a shelf that was too high and as a result, he died. Billy Bob Joe was devastated to hear of his grandfather’s death and created Reltub to make robot butlers to enhance the lives of humans. If one of our Robotic Butlers had been there when Billy Bob Joe’s grandfather reached for the cookie jar, it could’ve reached the cookie jar for him and his grandfather would still be alive. Reltub makes Robotic Butlers to do everyday tasks like making your bed and cleaning your room. This makes life easier by giving you more time to do things that you want to do and pursue your goals and happiness. So, instead of spending time making your bed and cleaning your room, you can work on things such as homework while the robotic butler other tasks. We value making our customers happy, creating quality products, and the lives of our customers.</h2>

<h2 class="title">What Can We Do?</h2>
<h2 class="excSummary">Reltub is working on making our customers happy by taking surveys to see what our company can do to improve our robots, adding and changing the design of our robots to help meet their needs, we also can change the repetitive tasks that your robot does. Our surveys are for the customers if they want us to change our product to better help them because we value doing whatever it takes to make our customer happy. The survey helps address whatever problems that they might have with their robotic butlers. The design of our robots is also important. It is designed so that we can change it if it isn’t what our clients like or want their robot to be like. Changing the repetitive tasks helps the robot adjust to whatever specific tasks that the client wants the robotic butler to do. With these feature’s the robot can be completely tailored to fit exactly whatever tasks that the customer wants it to do.

<h2 class="title">Structure</h2>
<h2 class="excSummary"> A normal corporate structure consists of various departments that contribute to the company's overall mission and goals. Common departments include Marketing, Finance, Operations, Human Resource, and IT. Organisation charts are diagrams that show the internal structure of the business. They make it easy to identify the specific roles and responsibilities of staff. They also show how different roles relate to one another and the structure of departments within the whole company.</h2>
