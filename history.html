<h3 class="history">Reltub was a company created in 2018 by founder Billy Bob Joe. Billy Bob Joe’s father, Greg was an elderly man and he was handicapped by his inability to walk. Greg, since he had to be in a wheelchair a lot, was unable to reach things on higher shelves. His cookie jar was accidentally put on a higher shelf by his visiting daughter. Greg was also suffering from heart failure because he had too many tasks to do, and it was too tiring on the heart. Sadly at the moment when he was reaching for the cookie jar his heart stopped, and he died.Billy Bob Joe in honor of his late father decided to create the company Reltub. Which creates robotic butlers. The robotic butlers can reach anything for you and they act as regular butlers, but are able to do more than regular butlers, because they don’t get tired and they have a better endurance level. And now every elderly person will have assistance when they need it.
