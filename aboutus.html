  <div class="col">Julia Chiang our CEO is the one of the founders of our company. She and one of Julia’s close friends decided to found this company, when Julia’s CTO’s grandpa died when he didn’t have the assistance when he needed it. This inspired her to start her company Reltub. Reltub designs and creates robotic butlers. These robotic butlers help men and woman, young and old around the house. These robots are programmed to fit the customer’s needs. Julia hopes that this product will help people in the ways that they need it to help them. Julia is 12 and she is working on building more factories around the world so that they can get the product all over the world.
